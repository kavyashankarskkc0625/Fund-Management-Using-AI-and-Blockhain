# Decision criteria prompt

DECISION_PROMPT = """
Based on the analysis of the provided government document, please review the following aspects:

{analysis_results}

Given this information, determine if the funding request should be APPROVED, REJECTED, or REVIEW (approved with conditions).
Provide a detailed justification for your decision, focusing on:
1. approved budget matching with the expenditure
2. Project details are clear and well-defined
3. no signs of fund misuse or discrepancies
4. Identified risks or concerns
5. Expected impact and outcomes

You must make a clear DECISION: either APPROVED or REJECTED.

Only use REVIEW (approved with conditions) status in exceptional cases where:
1. The document shows strong merit but has specific critical issues that must be addressed
2. The issues are clearly fixable with minor to moderate changes
3. The core of the proposal is sound and valuable

Your response should begin with "DECISION: [APPROVED/REJECTED/REVIEW]" followed by a concise justification.
For APPROVED decisions: highlight key strengths
For REJECTED decisions: explain the main reasons for rejection
For REVIEW decisions (use sparingly): specify exactly what conditions must be met for approval

Be decisive and authoritative in your assessment.
